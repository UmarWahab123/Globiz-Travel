            <p style="text-indent: 0;margin-top: 5px;">You need to wait until you have an offer from a university or college before applying for a visa. Your university or college will then be able to give you a document called a Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS). To do this, your chosen institution needs to be approved by the UK government as a licenced sponsor.<br> 
            <p style="text-indent: 0;margin-top: 5px;">You will need to complete an application and have it accepted before you arrive in the UK.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0;margin-top: 5px;">You will need to pay an application fee (£348 for students) and have a current passport or other valid travel document.You will also need to pay a fee called an Immigration Health Surcharge. This gives you access to the UK’s National Health Service. Students receive a 25 per cent discount on the usual cost of this surcharge – so the rate for student visa holders is £470 per year.</p>
